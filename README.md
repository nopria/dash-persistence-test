# Dash `pages`, demo of common input component spanning more pages

This example shows how to synchronize component values between pages. This example is an alternative way of synchronizing an input parameter common to many pages, obtained through persistence instead of `dcc.Store` as in https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-multi-page-app-demos#13-multi_page_sync_components
